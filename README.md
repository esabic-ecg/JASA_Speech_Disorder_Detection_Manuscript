This repo includes many of the scripts necessary for replicating our analyses of our submission to the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.

Note: Jupyter notebooks sometimes fail to load on GitHub, so just refresh the page if you are encountering any issues. Alternatively, one can download the .ipynb files themselves and open them within Jupyter Notebook.
